 # Collections Tracker
Collections Tracker is my take on the figurine tracking website [My Figure Collection](https://myfigurecollection.net/) in case the site goes down or the owner returns from being MIA and shuts down the site. The main use is to be able to check what items have been ordered without having to scrub through various websites and emails.
